# Lab 2 – Differential Pencil Beam 2D Dose Map

The calculation of a 2D relative dose map using using differential pencil beam (DPB) kernels.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Code
- `Deliverables/`
- `Saved Data/` - Saved numpy arrays of the previous manually convolved 2D dose maps. Allows subsequent parts to be troubleshooted/calculated easier, and avoid the computationally expensive manual convolution.
- `Visualization/` - plots and visual outputs not required, but are nice for troubleshooting and visualizing different parts.
- `Report.pdf`

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+

## Packages

- Scipy
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
